"""Battle models in a folder that is not a mod, for the viewer to draw.

Two kinds of folder are worth pointing the Models Editor at without installing
anything first:

* **a Blender export** - one folder per model, each holding ``<name>.mesh``,
  a ``textures/`` folder and sometimes ``<name>_bmdb.txt``, the entry written
  out ready to paste. That entry names its sheets where the finished mod will
  keep them (``unit_models/_units/reaper/textures/...``), not where they are
  now, so only the file NAME in it is any use here;
* **a copy-pasteable** ``data`` **folder** - ``unit_models/battle_models.modeldb``
  with the meshes and sheets it names, every path in it written from ``data/``
  as the game reads it rather than from the modeldb's own folder.

A folder is opened as a stand-in for a mod: :class:`FolderSource` carries the
``data``, ``modeldb`` and ``unit_models_dir`` the viewer's routes read, so an
entry is drawn by the same code a mod's is and a mesh no entry names goes
through :mod:`loosemesh`'s routes. Its ``data`` is the folder picked, and every
path an entry names is rewritten to where that file actually is under it - the
routes refuse anything outside it, exactly as they refuse anything outside a
mod's ``data``.

A mesh with no entry is offered skins guessed from its own folder. An export
holds one model per folder, so when its sheets are not named for the job the
first is taken as the main sheet and the second as the attachment, and the
viewer has a button to swap the two when that was the wrong way round.
